# Welcome to the Ultimate Software Developer Hiring Guide


### How this repo currently works/was set up
- This is a copy of the [docusaurus.io](https://www.docusaurus.io) getting started template. 

### Background
The goal of this guide is to help hiring managers and hiring professionals at tech companies attract and hire software developers the way software developers want to be hired, so that they can build world-class tech teams.

As a developer job marketplace, we interact with hundreds of software developers and companies hiring software developers every day. This gives us first-hand experience in what developers are looking for in their careers and workplaces, and it shows us what makes companies win at building world-class tech teams. 

We hope this guide will help companies build developer-centric hiring processes.
