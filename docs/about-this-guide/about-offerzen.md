# About OfferZen

OfferZen is a community-first job marketplace that helps companies accelerate their developer hiring. But this effort actually encompasses a much wider mission: To help developers and their teams thrive in the tech ecosystem. 

As a developer job marketplace, we interact with hundreds of software developers and companies hiring software developers every day. This gives us first-hand experience in what developers are looking for in their careers and workplaces, and it shows us what makes companies win at building world-class tech teams. 

With the help of these insights, we’ve helped over 2 000 companies across Europe and Africa attract and retain developers. 

# Who is this guide for?

This guide is intended for every person involved in the process of hiring developers, whether you’re an internal recruiter looking to reach out to candidates, a technical manager looking for the best method to assess developers’ skills, or whether you need to design an effective overarching hiring process from scratch.
