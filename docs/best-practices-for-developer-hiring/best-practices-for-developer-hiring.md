# Best practices for developer hiring

Before diving into hiring for a new role, there are a few important steps that will help you set yourself up for success throughout the process. 

As a start, here are general developer hiring tips to keep in mind:

* **Give ownership to one person for any given role:** This will help with accountability and minimise the chances of dropping balls. If you can’t settle on a single person to care about the whole process, then be sure to go into detail in terms of which people are going to take ownership of the individual parts of the process. 
* **Be extremely responsive with candidates: **You should never be the bottleneck in your own hiring process. Developers are likely interviewing with several companies at once, and even a slight delay in your process could mean you lose out on a strong candidate. 
* **Optimise for speed:** If somebody meets your hiring criteria, your goal should be to put an offer of employment in their hands as quickly as possible.
* **Drop-off will occur:** This can happen throughout every stage of the process, so it’s important to maintain a strong pipeline of candidates.
* **Focus on the candidate:** The golden thread that should run through your entire process is the [candidate experience](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/hiring-developers-why-a-candidates-experience-matters), no matter whether you end up hiring the person. Developers often share their experiences with their peers. Always assume that the person you’re interviewing is going to tell their friends or other community members about their experience interviewing at your company.
* **Be structured**: The interview process is a pretty big time investment from both sides, so make the most of it by having a structured agenda for what you’re hoping to accomplish. Everyone involved should know what their roles are. 
* **Be transparent:** Also explain what to expect to the candidate from the outset — developers value role and process transparency above all else in a hiring process.
