# Start with a scorecard

You should set up an internal scorecard in order to give your hiring team an objective idea of what the role entails and who you think can do the job. It allows you to come up with the practical definition of the right person for the role you are trying to fill. 

A scorecard typically consists of a few key components, including:

* **Mission**: A description of the high level goal of the position.
* **Outcomes: **The results you expect to see if the candidate does their job well.
* **Responsibilities**: The most important tasks the candidates will be responsible for.
* **Role-specific competencies: **Competencies required to be successful in the role. This will include both functional and behavioural competencies that are relevant to this specific job.
* **Company specific competencies**: Competencies required to thrive in your business and company culture, which often remains the same across roles.
* **Background**, such as skills, knowledge and experience: The career experience or background that will help the candidate achieve the objectives set out in the scorecard.
