# Doing reference checks

Reference checks help you double-check the accuracy of what the candidate has told you, and typically takes places at the end of a hiring process. 

Before doing any reference checks as part of your hiring process, decide whether or not you do background checks for everyone you hire. For example, do you reserve doing reference checks only for people who are working with clients, for every role, or for nobody at all?

Whatever you decide, it’s important that you stick to it. It’s easy to get swept up in the smiles and good vibes that are in the air after interviewing somebody that really fits in with the team and seems to tick every box, but that’s not necessarily a good reason to short-circuit your own process.

## Calling references

Before you dial a single digit, it’s really important that you articulate just what it is that you’re hoping to achieve by contacting somebody’s references. Are you looking to enlist third parties to provide you with information in order to help you make a hiring decision, or have you already made a decision and you’re doing a quick check for any serious red flags?

In general, try to avoid speaking to a reference before you’ve spoken to the candidate yourself. It might feel useful to have a heads up before they’ve even come in for an interview, but you’ve also potentially coloured your own first impression of this person with somebody else’s opinion.

Remember that your goal shouldn’t be to simply confirm what it is you’ve already learned about somebody during an interview. A useful mindset to adopt would be one of “everything we’ve heard about the candidate so far is great, but we just want to make sure that we haven’t missed anything”.

It should go without saying that you should always be respectful of the private nature of the candidate’s job search: Never phone somebody’s current workplace without their explicit permission, and don’t solicit your own personal network for information without doing your homework. The world is a small place, even more so in tech.

It’s helpful to frame the reference call as finding out how you can support the potential employee, as opposed to trying to catch them out. This makes a massive difference in the quality of the data you get out of the conversation.

## Doing background checks

Conducting a formal background check can be important in fields such as FinTech or financial services. If you’re operating in a different space you’ll need to decide how important clear credit and police records are in your particular context.

No matter which side of the aisle you’re on, an important consideration should be how these checks impact your hiring process and the candidate experience. 

Be sure to give people an adequate heads up as to why you’re running these potentially invasive background checks on them. Always provide an opportunity for the other person to be up-front about any irregularities that might come up.

**In South Africa, we can recommend these services that perform background checks:**

> Getting set up to do these yourself is cheaper and easier than you think. All you need to do is buy a fingerprint scanner, install some software and get somebody from your team to do a super short course from MIE.
