# No technical assessment

While doing nothing is always an option, it could also cost you dearly. One bad hire early-on can do a lot to hamper your ability to hit product roadmap goals, not to mention the potential cascading negative effects on your company culture.

You might be saving time in the short term by relying solely on your intuition, but we strongly recommend doing some form of due diligence to ensure that the person youâ€™re adding to your team is able to contribute meaningfully, shore up existing weaknesses and help you build an awesome product and team.
