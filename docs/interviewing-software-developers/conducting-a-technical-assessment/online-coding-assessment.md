# Online coding assessment

If you’re trying to optimise your hiring process to be able to handle really high volumes of people, then an online test can be a good way to accomplish that. These kinds of assessments function well in a remote hiring process, and are usually designed to be completed in the candidate’s own time. 

This makes online coding assessments much easier to fit into a schedule. It provides a well-defined block of time within which to focus while also preventing overly meticulous candidates from taking a weekend to complete what should be a 2 hour assessment.

On the other hand, this approach is quite impersonal. If you decide to include this in your interview process, make sure that somebody takes ownership of it. It should be their responsibility to maintain the integrity of the assessments. This means switching up your tests on a regular basis, moving people through the pipeline and being available as a human to talk to if the candidate has any questions.

Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that there will usually be costs involved in using an online code assessment service, either in the form of a subscription or per-use fee.

**> **The automatic scoring systems that many of these online testing tools use often lack the ability to pick up on nuance, meaning that smart developers often don’t get results that reflect their true ability. This can be counteracted by making it part of your process for a human to review the submitted code.
