# Take-home assessment

A take-home project is a piece of work that you assign to a candidate to complete in their own time. 

As with all of the other types of assessments, it’s important to be explicit about what it is that you’re assessing, what the deliverables are and how long you expect somebody to set aside for the project.

A well-briefed assessment project can easily be used as a jumping-off point for a **technical discussion** during an interview. Getting somebody to talk you through their solution can be incredibly insightful and can tell you a great deal about their decision-making and communication style.

Make sure you assign projects that are relevant to the work your company does. This has the added benefit of giving the candidate a glimpse of what it’ll be like to work for you. 

If you’re trying to hire people who enjoy solving interesting problems, make the assessment as engaging and representative of an actual day’s work as possible. This is especially important if it’ll take hours to complete your assessment. 

It’s worth noting that many developers rate take-home assessments as the most effective way to assess their technical skills — it’s well worth the effort of setting it up as part of your hiring process.

**Some good questions to ask in a technical discussion on a completed assignment include:**

* What tradeoffs did you make given you had limited time to complete the assignment?
* How did you choose which areas to prioritise in the assessment?
    * Given an extra hour, what would focus on?
* What was your thinking around using XXXX rather than XXXX?
