# Technical interview

A technical interview aims to assess the depth of the candidate’s knowledge about a particular technical skill. It is potentially the most abstract of the options available to you when looking to assess technical ability. While it can be the most convenient from a candidate experience perspective, it’s also extremely reliant on the person running the interview being highly technical themselves.

The effectiveness of a technical interview hinges entirely on the strength of the questions that you ask. While it might feel good to ask a trick question that somebody outside of your building might struggle to answer, you generally want to stick to questions that will allow candidates to showcase their own skill.

If you decide to adopt this strategy, it’s really important that the interviewer has a good grasp of the problem that they’re asking the interviewee to solve. If the lack in-depth understanding themselves, they will will struggle to drive the discussion and get all the information they need to assess the candidate’s technical ability.
