# Whiteboard interview

Traditionally, this type of interview refers to a candidate solving problem while writing code on a whiteboard. 

The classic combination of whiteboard and marker can be a really useful tool to determine somebody’s technical capabilities, as long as you make sure to be extra clear up front on what it is you’re assessing. Presenting somebody with an empty whiteboard and telling them to start designing solutions can be stressful at the best of times and will probably not result in them putting down their best work.

The whiteboard interview is most effective at establishing whether the candidate can logically structure a solution to a problem, which should be made clear up front or even in advance of the interview itself. 

Remember that your goal should be to assess somebody’s potential rather than ask them to showcase how well they can perform in a made-up test scenario; you’re conducting a technical assessment, not planning a technical ambush.
