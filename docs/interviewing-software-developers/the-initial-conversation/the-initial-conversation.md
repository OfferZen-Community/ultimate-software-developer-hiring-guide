# The initial conversation

How you approach this part of the hiring process will fall somewhere on a spectrum, with you trying to filter out people who ‘aren’t good enough’ on one end and ‘convincing people that your company is the best’ on the other.

We can distinguish between the following when it comes to the initial conversation between you and the candidate:

* The screening chat
* The sales chat

Considering this in the broader context of tech hiring in its current state, your aim should be to adopt more of a selling mindset. There are potentially a host of other competing organisations all trying to tap into the same talent pool as you are. If you’re not making an effort to convince candidates of why they should choose to work with you, you’ll quickly start losing out to companies who are.

Your goal should be to maximise knowledge on both sides of the table. Candidates should walk away knowing as much as possible about the work you do, and you need to know whether they’ll be able to make an impact on your team.
