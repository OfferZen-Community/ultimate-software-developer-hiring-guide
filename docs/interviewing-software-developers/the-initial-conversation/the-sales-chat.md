# The sales chat

A sales call helps you sell the role, the company and its, as well as the interview process itself — as opposed to looking for reasons to filter somebody out.

Getting buy-in like this is extra important if your hiring process has multiple steps. 

It’s optimistic to assume that developers can take time off from their current job to complete multiple steps, such as a 3-hour tech assessment followed by a panel interview. For a lengthier hiring process, extra work is needed on your end to sell the idea that working for your company and being on your team is worth that effort.

This should generally be the strategy that you adopt if you’re trying to build a hiring process that promotes a positive candidate experience. Remember that there’s nothing wrong with asking a few questions during a chat like this, as long as you keep in mind that it’s just as important to sell the role and your company to the person you’re talking to.
