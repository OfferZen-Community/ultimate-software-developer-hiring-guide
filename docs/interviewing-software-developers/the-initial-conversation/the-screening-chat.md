# The screening chat

A typical screening chat helps you qualify whether the candidate is good enough to proceed to the next stage of the interview process. This kind of conversation typically revolves around getting as much information from a candidate as possible. 

The types of questions asked during this kind of interaction will usually be focussed around the candidate’s educational background, their past work experience and filling in any gaps that were left after reading their profile. 

It’s also very important to provide an opportunity towards the end for the person you’re talking to to ask any questions that they might have.

> While this approach can give you a great deal of information in a relatively short amount of time, it can easily leave candidates feeling like they’ve just sat through an interrogation and will potentially do very little to promote a positive candidate experience.
