# Onboarding software developers

Finally, it’s the start day! How you welcome and onboard your new hire can make a big difference to their performance, not to mention how excited they are about remaining with your company. 

Hiring developers is difficult: don’t lose sight of retaining your hard-won team members. Most developers will easily be able to move on to a new opportunity if they are met with a lacklustre onboarding experience. 

Here are some steps to an epic onboarding process. Bonus: you can do all of these steps remotely!


## Make your new joiner feel welcome and connected

* **Send a welcome gift:** There’s nothing like receiving a gift just for you. You can do the same for new joiners with a welcome pack that includes essentials to make them feel welcome.
* **Be intentional about creating connection:** Nominate an onboarding buddy who will help answer questions, set the new joiner up, and generally be a ‘friendly face’ around the virtual office. In fact, you can have separate onboarding buddies for the role, and for your company culture.

* **Share key milestones:** Celebrate important milestones your new joiner has reached, such as their 1 month check-in, or their first meaningful contribution.
* **Invite them to social channels:** Have them join a social club at the company (e.g. online gaming club, board game club, book club, meditation circle).
* **Have agendaless meetings:** [Agendaless meetings](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/4-ways-luno-fosters-human-connection-fully-remote-team) are a great way to get the team to check in with each other and connect outside of work-related things.


## Help your new joiner feel confident in their role

* **Be available as a team:** Ensure the team has indicated their availability in their calendars, in case your new joiner needs help or would just like to chat.
* **Give context:** Spend time explaining how your team impacts the business and where they fit into this.
* **Set clear goals:** Explain all the projects they’re on, who they’ll work with, and the goals they’ll work towards in the first few months.
* **Onboarding checklists:** Include what they can complete to have an awesome, productive day. Also add social tasks like meeting team members in other parts of the business!
* **Have an internal knowledge base:** Make sure your new joiner can easily find important onboarding material such as culture documents, team videos, ‘How to docs’, etc.
* **Schedule regular check-ins:** For the first three months, make sure you’ve set up weekly 1:1 check-ins with your new joiner.
* **Avoid micromanaging:** Frequent check-ins can also feel like being micromanaged. Make it clear that you’re still figuring out a good cadence for check-ins and encourage their feedback.

When onboarding software developers, it’s useful to remind them of the [Kubler-Ross Change Curve](https://www.cleverism.com/understanding-kubler-ross-change-curve/). This boils down to the following: Since they are going through a massive change, their emotional state and performance will go through a cycle – that’s normal!

## Assessing how onboarding is going

If you’re an engineering manager, here are some useful questions to ask yourself to evaluate if **onboarding is progressing well **— and identify where to apply extra effort:

### Technical

* Has the new joiner been able to contribute to the codebase?
* Have they been able to ship changes in addition to the initial onboarding tasks?
* Have they been able to pair with other teammates to ship features?
* Have they been able to ship code individually?

### Processes

* Have they been able to contribute their thoughts and opinions?
* Are they comfortable with the squad’s cadence? (identify areas of improvement)

### Social / Cultural

* Has the new joiner been spending time with the various members of the team?
* Are they getting along with the team?
* Have they been able to attend team events?

### Inclusion

* Are they able to receive and process feedback while seeing the benefits of it? (or do they get defensive?)
* Is the team equipped to give good feedback?
* Are they able to articulate and share with you their feelings about their new role?
* Are they feeling positive about the team?
* Are they positive about the direction they’re heading?
* Are they excited for the future?
* Does the new joiner and the team know something about each other outside of the work context?
* Team event. Has the team taken some time to have a laugh with the new joiner?
* Have they been able to celebrate successes?
* Have they used their skills they are proud of to contribute meaningfully, seen an impact and made it public (e.g. demo’d a solution to the team)?
* Are they making net-positive contributions to the work?

Lastly, offering good mentorship to your new joiners is super important, and is a crucial aspect to maintaining developers even long after they’ve completed the onboarding process.
