# Reaching out to software developers

How you first reach out and capture a developer’s interest matters. Remember, they’re often inundated with messages from recruiters.  

> It’s ideal if the person closest to the role in question conducts the initial outreach. If you’re hiring developers, the tech manager or head of product should be reaching out, since they’ll have the most experience in that space.



Depending on how strong your brand is, the initial message could potentially be the first time the person you’re reaching out to has heard of your company. This means that it’s super important for you to be able to convey your **employer value proposition** concisely and convincingly.

## What is an employer value proposition?

An employer value proposition defines all the reasons why somebody should choose to work for your company, rather than your competitors.

It is explicitly different to your actual product. You can have an awesome product but a terrible employer value proposition, if you don’t make an effort to provide people with a great place to work. Components of your employee value proposition include:

* **Financial benefits**, such as stock options or bonuses
* **Perks**, such as flexible hours or number of leave days
* **Tech stack**
* **Career development opportunities**
* **Work content** — is it meaningful and aligned with a developer’s goals/interests? Keep in mind that developers often care deeply about how widely used and impactful your product is.

## Sending the first outreach message

We have seen companies on OfferZen reach out in a couple of different ways, ranging from short standardised templates, to much longer and personalised messages. Here are a few things to consider when deciding on what kind of initial outreach strategy to adopt:

* **Address them as an individual: **Nothing gives somebody the warm fuzzies like seeing a message from an interesting company that is more personalised to them as an individual. Making specific references to parts of a person’s profile that you found particularly interesting is a great way to prove to somebody that you’re serious about engaging with them.
* **Personalising every message can take time**: Be mindful not to let that affect the number of people that you reach out to. Your goal should be to strike a balance between thoughtful, personalised outreach and building a healthy candidate pipeline.
* **Give more sources of information: **When reaching out to somebody that you’re interested in interviewing, ensure that you provide other ways for candidates to find out more about you and your company. This information should be easily accessible and give the person a high level overview of what you’re all about.
* **Brief other hiring stakeholders:** If it isn’t practical for the hiring manager to reach out directly themselves, it can be useful to have somebody on your team take on a dedicated hiring support role. This person can own the outreach and interview process, however they will need to be extremely well briefed on all of the requirements for the roles in question.
