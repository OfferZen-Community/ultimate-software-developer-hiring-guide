# Reaching out to software developers

How you first reach out and capture a developer’s interest matters. Remember, they’re often inundated with messages from recruiters.  

> It’s ideal if the person closest to the role in question conducts the initial outreach. If you’re hiring developers, the tech manager or head of product should be reaching out, since they’ll have the most experience in that space.



Depending on how strong your brand is, the initial message could potentially be the first time the person you’re reaching out to has heard of your company. This means that it’s super important for you to be able to convey your **employer value proposition** concisely and convincingly.
