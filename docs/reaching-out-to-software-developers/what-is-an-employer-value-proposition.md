# What is an employer value proposition?

An employer value proposition defines all the reasons why somebody should choose to work for your company, rather than your competitors.

It is explicitly different to your actual product. You can have an awesome product but a terrible employer value proposition, if you don’t make an effort to provide people with a great place to work. Components of your employee value proposition include:

* **Financial benefits**, such as stock options or bonuses
* **Perks**, such as flexible hours or number of leave days
* **Tech stack**
* **Career development opportunities**
* **Work content** — is it meaningful and aligned with a developer’s goals/interests? Keep in mind that developers often care deeply about how widely used and impactful your product is.
